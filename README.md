## Description

The project is divided into several parts/aspects:

- The console
- Web static
- MySQL storage
- Web framework templating

### The console

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the objects of the project without the need of a visual interface. It is also a tool to validate the storage engine which will initially be a JSON file.
