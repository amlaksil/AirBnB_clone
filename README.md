# AirBnB_clone Project

The AirBnB_clone project is an important part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The goal of the project is to deploy on a server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

## Description

The project is divided into several parts/aspects:

- The console
- Web static
- MySQL storage
- Web framework templating
- RESTful API
- Web dynamic

### The console

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the objects of the project without the need of a visual interface. It is also a tool to validate the storage engine which will initially be a JSON file.

#### How to use the console

The console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```bash
echo "<command>" | ./console.py
```

To run the console in interactive mode, run the file `console.py` at the command line with no arguments.

```bash
./console.py
```
